Program Name: Bulk Beatmap Difficulty Editor

There are .osu files in a file tree like this:

[Folder]Songs
	[Folder](song name)
		[file]*.osu

In these .osu files there is a section that looks like this:

[Difficulty]
HPDrainRate:8
CircleSize:4
OverallDifficulty:8
ApproachRate:9
SliderMultiplier:1
SliderTickRate:1

The idea is to have the program crawl through the songs folder,
look for the .osu files, and be able to customise HPDrainRate,
CircleSize, OverallDifficulty, and ApproachRate to a value from 
1-10. User would input values for the program and hit run, which
would then change all the .osu files to the assigned values.
Ignore SliderMultiplier and SliderTickRate.
